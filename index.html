I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provideda
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection:  I'm learning css better, so this one wasn't as bad, but there
were still some strange behaviors I had to look into and tinker with. Javascript
can be kind of wonky as well, but it behaved for me for this project. Overall,
this one was much less nightmarish getting everything to work right.-->
