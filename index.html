I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provideda
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection:  I really enjoyed designing this website. I think there are a lot of neat ways 
to make the website look and behave like you want it to. I also think it is a good thing 
I shave my head, because otherwise css would make me pull my hair out. Fine tuning with css 
to make the site look exactly like I wanted to was an absolute nightmare, with little things 
it does automatically often screwing up things either with different page elements or with 
different responsive layouts. Granted, it is all still new and there are better ways and all 
that, but I was very unhappy with what I had to do to get the designs just right in this 
implementation of my website. Despite all of that, I am happy with what I was able to do, 
and wish I had more time to fine-tune things further. -->
